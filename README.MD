# Heroic Adventures CLI

Various scripts are listed under `./scripts` and can be run using the `index.js` file as shown below:

```js
node index.js simple
node index.js all
```

### Next steps

Create an encounter that does lots of iterations fighting monsters
against each other randomly, tracking wins and losses, and then
rank orders how good each monster is and gives them a score.

Figure out how to make the units equivilent in strength to the same
number of monsters.
